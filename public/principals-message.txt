"Education is the best investment for our future generations. Towards this, Army Public School Noida has dedicated itself to impart inclusive education to the students for their holistic and all round development. At an impressionable and tender age, the children cannot be expected to be sagacious enough to discriminate between ethical and unethical, moral and immoral, good and evil. However, I expect them to achieve a perfect blend of competence and character so as to strengthen the social fibre. APS NOIDA exposes students to a resume of multifarious activities and I am sanguine that they make full use of these to explore their creative talent."
